# Mission-to-Mars

In this project, I scraped data from multiple sites about mars data, stored it in a MongoDB database, and created a web application to show the results and scrape up-to-date data at the click of a button. I scraped the data using Splinter and Beautiful Soup, and for the Web Application I used Flask and Bootstrap to present my data I had scraped.
